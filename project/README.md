Recovery is a forum-style website that allows patients to share their experience dealing with a medical condition, anonymously ask questions, reply to someone else’s post, and query existing posts for a specific key phrase.

When a new user accesses the site they see a welcome message that invites them to login or register. If they scroll down they will see existing posts on the website.

Once the user registers, they are automatically logged in and can access two new pages:
1) the forum, where they can create a post, reply to someone else’s post or query existing posts for specific topics.
2) the profile page, where the user can sees their own posts and change their password.


Note: only logged in users can access the forum and the profile page.

Finally there is an about page with a description purpose of the site.
